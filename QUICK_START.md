- ✅ Animated timeline slider and polygon colors
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
- ✅ TypeScript throughout the application
- ✅ Modern UI with Ant Design components

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

**Required:**
- ✅ React 18 with Next.js 14
- ✅ TypeScript for full type safety
- ✅ Zustand for state management
- ✅ Leaflet with React-Leaflet for mapping
- ✅ Ant Design for UI components

**Additional:**
- ✅ react-range for timeline slider
- ✅ date-fns for date manipulation
- ✅ axios for API requests
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

3. **Test API Integration:**
   ```bash
   node test-api.js
   ```

4. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

1. **Timeline Control:**
   - Use the slider at the top to select time periods
   - Toggle between single hour and time range modes
   - Click "Reset to Now" to return to current time

2. **Drawing Polygons:**
   - Click "Draw Polygon" to enter drawing mode
   - Click on map to add points (3-12 points)
   - Double-click to complete polygon
   - Configure name and data source in modal

3. **Data Configuration:**
   - Use sidebar to manage data sources
   - Add custom color rules with thresholds
   - View active polygons and their values

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Polygons automatically update colors based on weather data
   - Click polygons for detailed information
   - Move map to explore different regions

## 🌐 API Integration

- **Primary API**: Open-Meteo Historical Weather API
- **No API Key Required**: Free for non-commercial use
- **Data Available**: Historical weather from 1940 onwards
- **Rate Limits**: Generous for personal use
- **Caching**: Implemented for performance optimization
